            Situated in Nasugbu, Batangas, Mt. Batulao is one of the most
            accessible mountains near Manila and is another top hiking
            destination in the Philippines. Mountain climbing enthusiasts come
            to Mt. Batulao because of its many peaks, boulder formation, grass
            ridges, and scenic views.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mt. Batulao is one of the easiest Batangas mountains to trek, making
            it a perfect location for training climbs. The journey to the summit
            is composed of open trails and rolling slopes.
            <br />
            <br />
            The mountain summit is about 811 meters above sea level. Mt. Batulao
            has 12 peaks that offer panoramas of Taal Lake, Cavite, Nasugbu
            coastline, Maragondon mountains, Tagaytay highlands, Balayan Bay and
            Mt. Maculot. The mountain offers two main trails, called “Old Trail”
            and “New Trail''.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Old Trail is located in the mountain's eastern section and has
            10 campsites/stations. The New Trail is on the west side of the
            mountain, and it features only one large campsite. The Evercrest
            Golf Course in Nasugbu is the jumpoff point to Mt. Batulao. From the
            golf course's entrance, you can walk or use the tricycle (local
            three-wheeler) to reach the start of the trails. Local guides, some
            of which are kids, would usually offer their services at the
            entrance.
