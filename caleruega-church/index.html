            Caleruega Church is one of the most famous churches in Batangas.
            This property is perched on the highest hill of Nasugbu Town.
            Caleruega is named after a Spanish municipality. Caleruega Church
            has beautiful architecture and a tranquil natural environment that
            makes it ideal for religious activities and spiritual retreats. In
            fact, it has become a well-known wedding venue. Caleruega is not
            just a church but a retreat center surrounded by lush scenery. Its
            main building is called the Transfiguration Chapel. This chapel has
            a nice colonial design and a peaceful ambiance. This is the most
            photographed part of the property and where most couples choose to
            wed.

            Aside from the main building, you can visit the other interesting
            sections of the complex during your visit. Some of these are the
            Fountain Compass, the Tent Chapel of Transfiguration, St. Dominic’s
            Point, Kampo Terraces and Amphitheater, and the Dominicum’s grand
            stairway. Caleruega’s outdoor area also features a koi pond, a
            Japanese garden, plant nursery, a worm farm, a hanging bridge, and
            various walkways. You can visit Caleruega Church on a day trip and
            spend a couple of hours exploring the property. However, since it’s
            also a retreat center, Caleruega is equipped with cottages, large
            halls, and a campsite to accommodate guests who wish to stay
            overnight.
